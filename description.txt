Builder Essentials aims to improve the building experience in Terraria tackling unpleasant Vanilla additions that make building much harder than it needs to be as well as adding QoL mechanics and items.

This mod uses keybinds that tModLoader turns off by default, please make sure you set them for the best experience!

For more info/previews check the mod's Homepage!

Happy Building!
