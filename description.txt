Builder Essentials is a mod designed to help and improve building in survival (and post Moon Lord / creative).

The main feature is a toggleable secondary accessory system allowing for 5-7 building accessories while being able to go back to your normal accessories, with a press of a key.
On top of that, this mod adds more useful tools! Check the mod's Homepage!

Default KeyBind to toggle Building Mode is N, be sure to set it up on the configs.

Happy Building! Kirtle
