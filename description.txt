Builder Essentials is a mod designed to help and improve building in survival (and post Moon Lord / creative).

The main feature is a toggleable secondary accessory system allowing for 5-7 building accessories while being able to go back to your normal accessories, with a press of a key.
On top of that, this mod adds more useful tools like the Creative Wrench, a Multi Painting Tool and set of Crafting Stations!

Default KeyBind to toggle Building Mode is N, be sure to set it up on the configs.

Happy Building! Kirtle
