Builder Essentials is a mod designed to help and improve building in survival (and post moonlord / creative).

The main feature is a toggleable seconday accessory system allowing for 5-7 building accessories while being able to go back to your normal accessories, with a press of a key.
On top of that, the mod also adds:

	- A MultiCraftingStation that can be used to craft all the recipes in the game. (Divided in 4 crafting stations: Pre hardmode, Hardmode, Themed furniture and Specialized items)
	- An accessory that allows infinite reach and fast placement. (Divided in 2 accessories, for each functionality alone as well)

Default KeyBind to toggle Building Mode is N, be sure to set it up on the configs.

Happy Building! Kirtle
