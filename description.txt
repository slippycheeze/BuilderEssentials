Builder Essentials is a mod designed to help and improve building in survival.

It features a toggleable secondary accessories system so you can always have your building accessories ready to be used (requires you to add your own accessories), without filling your inventory!

In the future, I hope to implement more helpful features to complement this mod.

Happy Building! Kirtle
