Builder Essentials is a mod designed to help and improve building in survival.

It features a toggleable secondary accessories system so you can always have your building accessories ready to be used (requires you to add your own accessories), without filling your inventory, an accessory that lets you place infinite blocks and a Crafting Station that supports every Recipe!

In the future, I hope to implement more helpful features to complement this mod.

Happy Building! Kirtle
